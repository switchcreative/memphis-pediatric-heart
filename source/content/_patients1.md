# For Patients

## The Heart

Heart disease in children is often thought to be a rare occurrence. However, many people have either a family member or know of a family who has been affected in some way by a pediatric heart condition. Heart defects occur in approximately 1% of births. Some babies are born with heart defects (“congenital” heart disease), while some children and adolescents can develop heart conditions as they mature and get older (acquired heart disease). There are also some conditions, primarily arrhythmias, that are inherited but not discovered until late childhood or adolescence. There is a wide spectrum of severity of these heart conditions. Thankfully, there are some heart conditions that more or less “go away” without any surgery or procedure. On the other hand, some congenital defects can be complex and life-threatening which may require multiple surgeries and procedures to repair. In-between these extremes, there are many defects or acquired conditions that can be repaired relatively easily today with either surgery or other procedures, such as heart catheterization. Fortunately, there has been a very significant improvement in treatment for pediatric heart disease over the last 15-20 years, particularly congenital heart disease, resulting in extremely good outcomes for most patients. As with anything, knowledge is power. Not only can MPH treat your child, but we can also provide the patient and family the information needed to move forward with concerns and treatments. 

### Common reasons for referral to see a pediatric cardiologist include the following:

##### Heart murmur
##### Chest pain with or without exercise
##### Syncope (fainting)
##### Hypertension (high blood pressure)
##### Palpitations/tachycardia (fast heart rate)
##### Congenital heart disease
